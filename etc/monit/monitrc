## Start Monit in the background (run as a daemon):
#
set daemon 120            # check services at 2-minute intervals
  with start delay 240    # optional: delay the first check by 4-minutes (by 
#                           # default Monit check immediately after Monit start)
set logfile syslog facility log_daemon
#set logfile /var/log/monit.log

## Set the location of the Monit id file which stores the unique id for the
## Monit instance. The id is generated and stored on first Monit start. By 
## default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.id.
#
# set idfile /var/.monit.id
set idfile /var/lib/monit/id

## Set the location of the Monit state file which saves monitoring states
## on each cycle. By default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.state. If
## the state file is stored on a persistent filesystem, Monit will recover
## the monitoring state across reboots. If it is on temporary filesystem, the
## state will be lost on reboot which may be convenient in some situations.
#
set statefile /var/lib/monit/state

include /etc/monit/conf.d/*
